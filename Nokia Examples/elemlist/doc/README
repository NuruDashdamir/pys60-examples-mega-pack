This is an example of a minimal extension for Python for Series 60.

Requirements
------------

- Series 60 SDK, 3rdEd or higher (tested with 3rdEd and 3rdEdFP2)
- Python for S60 1.9.x SDK package
- Open C/C++ plug-in
  Available from:
  http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/91d89929-fb8c-4d66-bea0-227e42df9053/Open_C_SDK_Plug-In.html 

Installation
------------

Place the Python for Series 60 SDK 3rdEd under the Symbian SDK installation
directory, at the same level as the "epoc32" directory. Extract the SDK zip
package here(On Windows if you have WinZip installed, right-click on the zip
and in the menu select : 'Winzip->Extract to here')

Building
--------

Modify the mmp file to include "Location" capability while building for 3rdEdFp2 
and higher devices. A script file build_all.cmd that does all the necessary 
steps (and some extra cleanup, just to be sure) has been provided for
convenience. You can either use that or perform the build manually using these 
instructions.
  
1. Go to the elemlist directory. Enter:

     bldmake bldfiles

2a. To build the extension for the phone, enter:

     abld build gcce urel
     abld freeze
     abld build gcce urel

2b. To build it for the emulator environment, enter:

     abld build winscw udeb
     abld freeze
     abld build winscw udeb

  Note: The "freeze" step only needs to be done once. After changing
  the code, just one "abld build gcce urel" or "abld build winscw udeb"
  will rebuild the code properly.

3a. For the phone build: 
    You should find the built module in:     

     (path to your SDK)\epoc32\release\gcce\urel\251_elemlist.pyd

    Use the provided pkg file(group\elemlist.pkg) to create a SIS file for
    installation onto the phone.

Testing
-------

Start the interpreter and select 'Interactive Console' from the Options 
menu. Then try the following code:

   from elemlist import *
   cell=cons(1,2)
   car(cell)
   cdr(cell)

The results of the last two commands should, of course, be 1 and 2.
