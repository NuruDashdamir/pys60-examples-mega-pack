# pys60-examples-mega-pack

These examples will help you if you code for PyS60.
Most of them tested on PyS60 2.0.0 (which based on Python 2.5.4).

UPDATE: After 17 months I finally tested most examples and fixed some of the bugs on some codes. Keep in mind that I haven't tested all examples in "PyS60 from Mobile Python Book" and "PyS60 Good Examples - Jurgen Scheible" folders. But most of them should work fine.
