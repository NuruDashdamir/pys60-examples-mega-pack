# pys60-examples-mega-pack

I collected many examples for PyS60 and tried to organise it. These examples can help if you code for PyS60.

There are so many examples (900+ total) and I will try to organise and upload all of them as soon as possible. I can't guarantee all of them will work, but most of them works. I didn't merge folders because it can cause big problems if there are so many non-working examples.
