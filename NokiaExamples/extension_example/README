This is an example of a minimal extension for Python for Series 60.

Requirements
------------

- Series 60 SDK, 1.2, 2.0 or 2.1 (tested with 2.0)
- Python for Series 60 SDK 1.0
- if you want to compile for the emulator: Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or
  later

Installation
------------

Unpack the code to a directory "elemlist" under your Symbian SDK, at
the same level as the "epoc32" directory. That is, the "epoc32"
directory should be accessible as "..\epoc32" from the elemlist
directory. E.g. your epoc32 directory is
\symbian\7.0s\series60_v20\epoc32, place the elemlist code in
\symbian\7.0s\series60_v20\elemlist.

Building
--------

These are the step-by-step instructions. A script file build_all.cmd
that does all of the necessary steps (and some extra cleanup, just to
be sure) has been provided for convenience. You can either use that or
perform the build manually using these instructions.

1. Go to the elemlist directory. Enter:

     bldmake bldfiles

2a. To build the extension for the phone, enter:

     abld build armi urel
     abld freeze
     abld build armi urel

2b. To build it for the emulator environment, enter:

     abld build wins udeb
     abld freeze
     abld build wins udeb

  Note: The "freeze" step only needs to be done once. After changing
  the code, just one "abld build armi urel" or "abld build wins udeb"
  will rebuild the code properly.

3a. For the phone build: 
    You should find the built module in:     

     (path to your SDK)\epoc32\release\armi\urel\elemlist.pyd

    Transfer the elemlist.pyd file to your phone, in the \system\libs
    directory.

3b. For the emulator build:
    You should find the built module in:

     (path to your SDK)\epoc32\release\wins\udeb\elemlist.pyd
   
    To make the file available to the Python interpreter, copy it
    to:

     (path to your SDK)\epoc32\release\wins\udeb\z\system\libs\elemlist.pyd

Testing
-------

Start the interpreter and try the following code:
	
   from elemlist import *
   cell=cons(1,2)
   car(cell)
   cdr(cell)

The results of the last two commands should, of course, be 1 and 2.
